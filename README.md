# financial-data-validator
A high-performance, extensible framework for validating financial data across protocols like FIX, Binary, TCP, and Multicast. Designed for regression, functional, and performance testing in high-frequency trading (HFT) and institutional finance environments.

#  Key Features
Multi-Protocol Support: Validate FIX messages, binary payloads, TCP streams, and multicast market data feeds.

Automated Test Execution: Create reusable test cases and scenarios for E2E financial protocol validation.

Performance Benchmarks: Measure latency, throughput, and message loss in real time.

Sequence & Order Validation: Detect out-of-sequence, dropped, or malformed messages in order books.


 # Use Cases
 Validate market data integrity in exchange simulators

 Detect anomalies or slippage in order execution workflows

Benchmark protocol compliance for trading infrastructure

QA automation for financial backend systems

 Architecture
Modular design with decoupled:

Message Parsers (FIX, Binary, etc.)

Validators

Test Case Executors

Optional plug-in hooks for:

Kafka ingestion

Elastic search storage

Real-time alerts
